### What Is A Programming Language?
- Source code (human readable)
  - => interpreter: goes line by line and executes it consecutively
  - => or compiler: takes code all at once, reads the entire file and then translates that to machine code.

### [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/)
- cypthon VM (virtual machine)

### How to Run Python Code
- Terminal
- Code Editors: sublime text, visual studio code
- IDEs: PyCharm, Spyder
- Notebooks: jupyter
- `python3`
- `exit()`
- `python main.py`
